# FEMA Natural Disaster Data

This project utilizes data from FEMA found here: https://www.fema.gov/openfema-dataset-disaster-declarations-summaries-v1

Columns from the csv utilized were:

`disasterNumber` `state` `fyDeclared` `incidentType` `title` `incidentBeginDate` `incidentEndDate`

A python script was then written to analyze the data from the csv file that was downloaded. The .ipynb Jupyer notebook file walks through this process
